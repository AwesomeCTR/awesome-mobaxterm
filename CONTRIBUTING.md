### General conditions

This is an attempt to make a curated list of high-quality, maintained, useful MySQL/related software.

- Submitting software:
  - Must be free and open source. Must have an acknowledged open source license. I'm not a lawyer, so I'll go with the
    FSF listings. Proprietary, trial, shareware, halfway open sourced etc., will not be accepted, and will be removed.
  - Must be reasonably recognized and adopted. Please do not add your newly created untested scripts.
  - The code must have been active in some production environment and must be in a reasonably GA quality.
  - Code must not be abandoned/discontinued.
  - Do not include links to documentation. This is not an "awesome library" repository. We might go for that in the future.
- If e-book, must be free (as in free beer) and without commitment from the user (e.g. no requirement to enter personal details,
  no requirement to login with social network ID, etc.)
- Likewise, all other resources (websites etc.), must all be open to all and must not require payment nor registration/credentials.
  - The only exception being Newsletters, where an email address is required by definition. Newsletters are accepted under the
    condition that an email address is their *only requirement*.
- This is not the place for slides, videos, specific blog posts, specific SQL queries. Will possibly open a dedicated list for these.
- Avoid politics and religious wars.

### Request guidelines

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Categories & items must be added by alphabetical order (`utf8_general_ci`).
- Use the following format: `[item](link) - description.`
- Each item should be limited to one link
- The link should be the name of the package/project/library/resource etc.
- Avoid superlatives or FUD and otherwise just stick to a reasonable description.
- Do not capitalize description (i.e. avoid "The Tool to End All Tools")
- English only
